# ðŸ‘‹ Hey There! I'm Tyler M-Wise,
I'm a coder who develops games using various programming languages, including Luau, Java, HTML, C# and JavaScript. I work on these with a friend, and we run a company called [TeamTBM](https://teamtbm.org?utm_source=tylermwise.uk), which we founded to help others with programming and game development.
  
My programming journey began when I was ten, learning HTML. Since then, Iâ€™ve picked up many other languages, with Luau, HTML and C# being among my favourites.  
  
Iâ€™ve also volunteered on several IT projects for schools. For instance, I helped run an after-school coding club for Year 5 pupils, assisting them with learning programming skills. It was inspiring to help these young students grasp ICT concepts. Experiences like this really motivate me to keep learning and improving. Alongside this, Iâ€™ve held IT-related roles such as Digital Ambassador and, later, Digital Leader. I also work as an asset designer for DoubleJGames Ltd, creating models, 3D models and graphical icons.  
  
Choosing my GCSEs was a pivotal moment. I opted for Computer Science, Film Studies, Health and Social Care, and Photography. I was delighted with my results, which were much better than Iâ€™d anticipated, and Iâ€™m now a Grade 9 Photographer! Not only that, but I've also achieved a few awards, including Explorer and Discovery Awards from the [John Muir Trust](https://www.johnmuirtrust.org/john-muir-award?utm_source=tylermwise.uk), recognising my awareness of and responsibility towards wild places. I also received an award from the [UK Bebras Challenge](https://www.bebras.uk/?utm_source=tylermwise.uk), run by [Hertford College, University of Oxford](https://www.hertford.ox.ac.uk/?utm_source=tylermwise.uk).  
  
Having completed my ICT Extended Diploma, I now work as a marketing and events assistant with [Adventures + Wisdom Institute](https://www.aw.institute?utm_source=tylermwise.uk), helping design and create [DABBBLE, a platform and network launching in 2025](https://www.aw.institute/dabbble/about?utm_source=tylermwise.uk) that emphasises participation in creative activities. DABBBLE encourages people to try out different creative roles and have fun while gaining experience, making connections, and building confidence. I also work with [TechResort CIC](https://techresort.org?utm_source=tylermwise.uk), helping tackle digital exclusion by repurposing devices and providing ICT skills support for a wide range of different people.  
  
Outside of all this, I work freelance as a [photographer](https://tylermwise.uk/photography-projects/) and [web designer](https://tylermwise.uk/web-design/), and continue to develop video games on Roblox, with my current project being the [TBM Universe](https://teamtbm.org/universe?utm_source=tylermwise.uk).  
  
Beyond my other work, I enjoyed a summer at [West End House Camp](https://westendhousecamp.org?utm_source=tylermwise.uk) in 2024 as a Senior Camp Counsellor, taking on the additional roles of photography and videography to document the camp experience.
