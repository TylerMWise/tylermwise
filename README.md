# ðŸ‘‹ Hey There! I'm Tyler M-Wise,
I am a coder that develops games in different coding languages such as Lua, HTML, C# (C Sharp), and JavaScript! I design it with one of my friends. We both own a company called [TeamTBM](https://teamtbm.org/) which was created to help the world in Programming and Game Developing.  

When I was ten I began learning HTML much more, and ever since then, I have been learning many new things. I enjoy most languages I have learnt but some of my favourites are Lua, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and C#. There are more, these are just some of my favourites. The site you are currently looking at is made by me using some Bootstrap for the frontend.  

I have been involved in volunteering with many schools IT projects. For example, with year 5s, Iâ€™ve assisted in an extracurricular class teaching programming skills. I have helped at this club every Tuesday and Thursday for an hour. It has been inspiring to help young students learn, and this encourages me to keep learning and developing my skills.  

Iâ€™ve also done various other IT related jobs. Not only that, but Iâ€™ve been a [Digital Ambassador for TechResort](https://techresort.org/) and an Asset Designer for DoubleJGames LTD, creating models, 3D Models and graphical icons.  

Furthermore, I have done many things in my life, but the most significant decision I had to make was picking my GCSEs. I decided to go for Computer Science, English Language, English Literature, Film Studies, Health and Social Care, Mathematics and Photography, as I am currently studying Photography as one of my GCSEs, I am continually improving my photos, and I hope to improve this a lot over the years in my life.  

Some of my achievements include being awarded an Explorer Award and Discovery Award by the [John Muir Trust](https://www.johnmuirtrust.org/john-muir-award), in recognition of awareness and responsibility for wild places. I have been awarded the [UK Bebras Challenge](https://www.bebras.uk/) award from [Hertford College, University of Oxford](https://www.hertford.ox.ac.uk/).  

To enrich my IT and Computing studies I have studied many online courses such as an introduction to computers and computer systems, an introduction to cyber security, and a responsive web design course.
