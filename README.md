# ðŸ‘‹ Hey There! I'm Tyler M-Wise,
I am a coder that develops games in different coding languages such as Lua, HTML, C# (C Sharp), and JavaScript! I design it with one of my friends. We both own a company called [TeamTBM](https://teamtbm.org/) which was created to help the world in Programming and Game Developing.  

When I was ten I began learning HTML much more, and ever since then, I have been learning many new things. I enjoy most languages I have learnt but some of my favourites are Luau, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and C#. There are more, these are just some of my favourites.  

I have been involved in volunteering with a few IT projects for schools. For example, with year 5s, Iâ€™ve assisted in an extracurricular class teaching programming skills. I helped at these clubs weekly. It was and always will be inspiring as I get the chance to help young students learn, and watch them as they understand ICT. This encourages me to keep learning and developing my skills!  

Iâ€™ve also done various other IT-related jobs. Not only that, but Iâ€™ve been a Digital Ambassador and then later a Digital Leader. I am also a known Asset Designer for DoubleJGames LTD, creating models, 3D Models and graphical icons.  

Furthermore, I have done many things in my life, but the most significant decision I had to make was picking my GCSEs. I decided to go for Computer Science, English Language, English Literature, Film Studies, Health and Social Care, Mathematics and Photography. I am thrilled to say my results were really good compared to what I thought I was going to get, and I am pleased to say I am a Grade 9 Photographer!  

Some of my achievements include being awarded an Explorer Award and Discovery Award by the [John Muir Trust](https://www.johnmuirtrust.org/john-muir-award), in recognition of awareness and responsibility for wild places. I have been awarded the [UK Bebras Challenge](https://www.bebras.uk/) award from [Hertford College, University of Oxford](https://www.hertford.ox.ac.uk/).  

To enrich my IT and computing I have studied many online courses such as an introduction to computers and computer systems, an introduction to cyber security, and a responsive web design course. I am also now studying an ICT Extended Diploma, which pushes me and allows me to do Game Design and use Creative Technologies!
